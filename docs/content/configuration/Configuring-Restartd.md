# Configuring Restart Daemon

Restartd is a daemon for checking running and not running processes.
It reads the /proc directory every n seconds and does a POSIX regexp on the process names.
You can execute a script or a program if the process is or is not running.

By default if enabled, the ntpd is guarded using restartd.
You can enable the restartd service by settings `ENABLE_RESTARTD` to `1`.

You can add your own services to restartd to automatically restart the services when they are killed due to out-of-memory issues or when something flaky is going on.

## Configuration options

| Configuration            | Options                        | Description |
| ---                      | ---                            | ---         |
| `ENABLE_RESTARTD`         | `1` to enable, `0` to disable. | Start or Stop `restartd` at boot time|


## Restartd Config

To add your services, add a configuration line to the `/etc/restartd.conf`.

Use the following format:
```bash
# <process_name> <regexp> <action_if_not_running> <action_if_running>

# process_name: the name of the process which is just for logging
# as it does not affect for the regexp
#
# regexp: the POSIX regular expression for the command line of the
# process
#
# action_if_not_running: a script or program name to execute if the
# regexp does not match the full process command line
#
# action_if_running: a script or program name to execute if the regexp
# matches the full process command line
```

For example:
```bash
ntpd "/usr/sbin/ntpd" "/tmp/sd/firmware/etc/init/S51ntpd restart" "/bin/echo '*** NTPd was restarted from restartd... '"
```
