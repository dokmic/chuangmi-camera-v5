# Camera Options

## Ceiling Mode

Ceiling mode is introduced to set the correct rotation to camera's that are mounted on the ceiling.
If `CEILING` is enabled, the camera will use `flip` and `mirror_mode` to rotate the camera accordingly.

Ceiling mode can be configured in the main `config.cfg` by setting `CEILING` from `0` to `1`.

## Night mode

Night mode (B/W mode) filters all the color out.

## Mirror mode

Mirror mode flips the image vertically.

## Flip mode

Flip mode does what it says: It horizontally flips the image bottom up.

## IR Cut

Does image correction by filtering out infrared light. 
This improves the image quality when you have lots of additional red light.

* Auto Exposure
* Auto Focus

* Auto Sharpen
* Black Level Correction
