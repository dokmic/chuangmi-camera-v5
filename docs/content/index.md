## MiiCam is retiring!

Maintaining a webcam project like this one in a secure manner is a lot of work!
As this camera is getting older, it needs more and more attention to determine keep it up to date and (semi) "secure".

Because I'm not using the camera that much myself, I will sunset the project on October 1st 2020.

In a few months, I will stop maintaining this project.

I've already removed the prebuild releases as the older were getting really old...
I recommend the poweruser to build their own firmware using the instructions,
and less tech savy users to start looking for a better and more modern camera.

## What is this project?

You are reading the documentation for the MiiCam project.

The MiiCam project is a firmware hack for the Xiaomi Chuangmi IP Camera, a low budget ip camera which can be ordered online for around 12 to 15 dollar each.

It provides several additional software utilities that extend the functionality of this ip cam. Without this hack the camera is limited to usage through the MiiHome app, a cloud based viewer that only works well in mainland China.

By copying and unpacking the firmware to an SD card, it provides web based management, a local RTSP stream, motion detection, and more....

!!! note "Don't forget to read the security considerations!"
    Make sure you read the [security consideration](/Security-Considerations) before installing the hack!
